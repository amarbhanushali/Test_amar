# Encryption

### Cookies & Encryption

By default, all cookies generated by Laravel are encrypted and signed so that they can't be modified or read by the client. If you would like to disable encryption for a subset of cookies generated by your application, you may use the `$except` property of the  `App\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies` middleware, which is located in the  `app/Http/Middleware` directory:

```PHP
<?php
/**
 * The names of the cookies that should not be encrypted.
 *
 * @var array
 */
protected $except = [
    'cookie_name',
];
```

The all magic within the middleware `Cookie/Middleware/EncryptCookies.php`:

```PHP
<?php

    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @param  \Closure  $next
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        return $this->encrypt($next($this->decrypt($request)));
    }
    
    /**
     * Encrypt the cookies on an outgoing response.
     *
     * @param  \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response  $response
     * @return \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response
     */
    protected function encrypt(Response $response)
    {
        foreach ($response->headers->getCookies() as $cookie) {
            if ($this->isDisabled($cookie->getName())) {
                continue;
            }

            $response->headers->setCookie($this->duplicate(
                $cookie, $this->encrypter->encrypt($cookie->getValue())
            ));
        }

        return $response;
    }
    
```
